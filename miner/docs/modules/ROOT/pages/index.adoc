[NOTE]
====
Over time many people complained the project isn't very accessible.
I'm aware of it and have no intentions of changing it.

First the documentation is rather technical, so it's hard to get into it, however not impossible.
If someone really wants it, with time things can happen.
Also, a Discord server is available where you can find help (and I mean help, not taking you by the hand and do it all for you).

Secondly, it isn't designed to be a plug-and-play project.
Instead, it is designed to be functional, even if it means making it harder to apprehend for "common people".
